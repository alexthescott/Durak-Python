# Durak Python3 üÉè

Durak is a popular Russian card game, typically played with 3-6 people. The objective is to not be the final player with cards remaining. Although there are many variations, the rules presented below describe *modified seige durak*, which is my prefered durak flavor, and arguably the best way to play.

### First Attack
To begin, each player is dealt 6 cards. The top card from the deck is flipped and placed next to the deck. The suit of the flipped card denotes the *Uber Suit*. The player with the lowest card (2's are low) begins the first attack by playing a card on the table. Players attack to the left, and defend from the right. 

### Defending 
To defend, a player must play a card which is in the same suit, and a higher value than the attack. Additionally, the defender can defend with an *Uber Card* irrespective of card value. If the *Uber Suit* is ‚ô†, a 10 of ‚ô• may be defeated by a 2 of ‚ô†. *Uber Card* attacks must be defended by an *Uber Card* of a higher value. 

### Contributing
Any non-defending player can contribute to an attack by playing any card with the same value of cards played on the table. This is to say if a 2 and a 5 have been played, any non-defending player can play their 2's or 5's. Contributers cannot play more cards than the defending player has available in their hand. Any contributed attack must be defended.

### End of turn
If the defender is able to defend every card they are attacked with, the table is cleared and sent to a discard pile. If the defender is not able to defend the table, they must pick up the table, forfiting their next attack. Each player must have at least 6 cards at the end of an attack. The attacker picks up cards from the deck first, continuing counterclockwise until every player has enough cards.

### End Game
Once all of the cards from the deck are gone, players continue battling untile a single player remains. The final player remaining after the last defence is the durak, or 'fool'. This is to say that every player wins excluding one luckly loser üòÅ

This game is called 'fool' because even a fool can learn and win.
